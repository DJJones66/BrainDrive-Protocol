Without professional authentication, purchased coins may prove to be inauthentic, resulting in financial loss and collection integrity compromise.\n\n**Budget Overrun**\nMarket prices for certified numismatic items fluctuate based on rarity, condition, and collector demand. Emotional purchasing decisions or competitive bidding at auctions may drive costs above planned allocation, jeopardizing the ability to complete the full decade set.\n\n## First Milestone\n\nAcquire one professionally graded (PCGS or NGC) 1960 Roosevelt dime in acceptable condition, sourced through a reputable dealer or authenticated marketplace, to establish the foundation of the collection.\n\n## Scope\n\nThe collection encompasses all ten calendar year issues of the Roosevelt dime minted between 1960 and 1969 at United States Mint facilities. Each coin must be independently certified by a recognized third-party grading service confirming authenticity and assigned a numerical grade. The scope includes research, acquisition, verification, and documentation of each acquisition.\n\n## Non-Goals\n\nAcquisition of die varieties, mint marks beyond standard production (unless naturally occurring), proof sets, or special mint issues falls outside the defined scope. Portfolio management, value appreciation tracking, or resale activity is not addressed by this specification. The specification does not extend to dimes from years outside the 1960-1969 range.\n\n## Open Questions\n\n- What budget ceiling should be established for the complete decade set, and how should funds be allocated across individual years?\n- Which specific grade range (Mint State vs. circulated) constitutes an acceptable acquisition standard for each coin?\n- What verification steps should be mandatory before each purchase to ensure authenticity?",

This milestone validates that the unified node can successfully replicate all functionality currently provided by the three separate nodes.\n\n## Scope\n\n- Design and implement a unified skill node architecture supporting three operational modes: interview, spec, and plan\n- Develop mode determination logic that interprets input signals to activate the appropriate mode\n- Preserve all existing approval safety mechanisms and intent validation checks\n- Ensure backward compatibility with legacy workflow intent patterns\n\n## Non-Goals\n\n- Adding new capabilities beyond the current interview, spec, and plan functionalities is out of scope for the initial implementation\n- Decommissioning or removing the legacy nodes until parity is confirmed and validated\n- Modifying the underlying prompt matrix structure at this stage\n\n## Open Questions\n\n- What specific input signals or metadata should trigger mode selection (e.g., intent keywords, context flags, user role)?\n- How should the node handle ambiguous or unrecognized input that could map to multiple modes?\n- What are the precise approval safety checkpoints that must be retained during consolidation?\n- Should mode switching be explicit (user-directed) or implicit (system-determined)?",
    "no-prefix-interview-test": "# no-prefix-interview-test Spec\n\n## Goal\nReplace three workflow nodes with a single skill node to streamline the system architecture while maintaining existing functionality.\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Interview specifications continue to function without modification\n- Plan flows execute identically to the current three-node implementation\n- No regression in approval gate behavior\n- Routing logs continue to be generated correctly\n\n## Current State\nThe existing system consists of three workflow nodes that handle approval gates and routing logs. These nodes collectively manage the workflow execution path and maintain audit trails. The specific node names were not identified during the interview.\n\n## Risks\n- **Intent Compatibility Loss**: The migration may lose critical intent signals that the current three-node architecture preserves, potentially breaking existing workflows that depend on specific behavioral nuances.\n- **Functional Regression**: Without clear documentation of each node's responsibilities, there is risk of incomplete functionality transfer.\n- **Test Coverage Gaps**: The new skill node must pass the complete workflow test matrix used for the current implementation.\n\n## First Milestone\nAchieve passing results on the same workflow test matrix currently used for the three-node implementation. This validates functional equivalence before proceeding to production deployment.\n\n## Scope\n- Identify and document the three workflow nodes being replaced\n- Consolidate approval gate logic into the new skill node\n- Migrate routing log generation capabilities\n- Preserve all existing plan flow interactions\n- Execute full workflow test matrix validation\n\n## Non-Goals\n- Modifying interview specification formats or structures\n- Changing plan flow orchestration logic\n- Adding new functionality beyond parity with existing nodes\n- Refactoring upstream or downstream systems that consume workflow outputs\n\n## Open Questions\n- What are the specific names and identifiers of the three workflow nodes being replaced?\n- What are the exact responsibilities and edge case behaviors of each node?\n- How is intent compatibility currently encoded in the three-node architecture?\n- What test cases comprise the workflow test matrix?\n- Are there any configuration parameters that vary between environments?",
    "full-prompt-matrix-1772129405": "# full-prompt-matrix-1772129405 Spec\n\n## Goal\n\nBuild a unified node for workflow tasks that consolidates functionality from separate interview spec and plan flows into a single, integrated system.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- Achieve full parity between the existing interview spec flow and plan flow\n- Maintain safe approval processes throughout the unified workflow\n- Ensure no regression in routing functionality during and after consolidation\n\n## Current State\n\nThe system currently operates with separate interview spec and plan flows, creating disconnected workflow processes that require maintenance of two distinct routing mechanisms.\n\n## Risks\n\nRoute regressions may occur when consolidating the separate flows into a unified node, potentially impacting existing workflow behavior and approval safety.\n\n## First Milestone\n\nEstablish full prompt matrix parity between the interview spec flow and the plan flow, demonstrating functional equivalence across both routing paths.\n\n## Scope\n\n- Consolidate interview spec flow and plan flow into a unified node architecture\n- Implement parity validation between legacy routes\n- Preserve existing approval safety mechanisms\n- Migrate routing logic to support both workflow paths\n\n## Non-Goals\n\n- Modify core interview or planning logic outside the unification effort\n- Build new workflow capabilities not present in existing flows\n- Replace underlying approval safety systems\n\n## Open Questions\n\n- What are the specific technical implementation requirements for the unified node interface?\n- Which routing paths differ between the interview spec flow and plan flow that require harmonization?\n- What validation approach will confirm successful parity between the two legacy flows?"

This milestone validates that the unified node can successfully replicate all functionality currently provided by the three separate nodes.\n\n## Scope\n\n- Design and implement a unified skill node architecture supporting three operational modes: interview, spec, and plan\n- Develop mode determination logic that interprets input signals to activate the appropriate mode\n- Preserve all existing approval safety mechanisms and intent validation checks\n- Ensure backward compatibility with legacy workflow intent patterns\n\n## Non-Goals\n\n- Adding new capabilities beyond the current interview, spec, and plan functionalities is out of scope for the initial implementation\n- Decommissioning or removing the legacy nodes until parity is confirmed and validated\n- Modifying the underlying prompt matrix structure at this stage\n\n## Open Questions\n\n- What specific input signals or metadata should trigger mode selection (e.g., intent keywords, context flags, user role)?\n- How should the node handle ambiguous or unrecognized input that could map to multiple modes?\n- What are the precise approval safety checkpoints that must be retained during consolidation?\n- Should mode switching be explicit (user-directed) or implicit (system-determined)?"
