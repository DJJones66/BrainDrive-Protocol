# Spec Generation Skill

When this skill is triggered, generate a comprehensive feature specification document based on:

    The interview conducted (if /interview was run)
    The landscape research (if /landscape was run) — incorporate findings into Technical Context and cite the build-vs-adopt recommendation
    Any existing conversation context about the feature
    User clarification if needed

Process

    Review Context
        Read through the conversation to gather all feature information
        Check if /landscape was run — if so, read the landscape.md and factor its recommendation into the spec (adopt, fork, or build-from-scratch)
        Check BrainDrive-Library for related projects and decisions
        Identify any gaps or unclear areas

    Clarify Gaps (if needed)
        If critical information is missing, ask the user using AskUserQuestion
        Focus only on blockers - don't re-interview

    Generate Spec
        Read system/templates/spec-template.md from the Library
        Fill in all sections based on gathered information
        Mark incomplete sections with [TODO: ...]

    Write to File
        Create the spec in BrainDrive-Library: projects/active/[project-name]/spec.md
        Create the project folder if it doesn't exist
        Or ask user for preferred location if not using Library

    Review with User
        Summarize what was captured
        Highlight any TODO items or open questions
        Ask if anything needs adjustment

Spec Quality Checklist

Before presenting the spec, ensure:

    Overview is clear and concise (someone could understand the feature in 30 seconds)
    Target user is specific (which persona, what context)
    Problem statement explains the pain, not just the solution
    User stories describe specific flows, not vague capabilities
    User story formatting — title + summary sentence exposed; source, steps, and acceptance criteria behind <details> accordion (keeps the doc scannable without losing detail)
    Acceptance criteria use Given-When-Then format for each user story
    Invariants define what must ALWAYS be true (drives property-based tests)
    Edge cases are cataloged with expected behavior
    MVP scope is clearly bounded (what's in AND what's out)
    Technical context identifies all integration points
    Test strategy specifies test levels, verification approach, and baseline impact
    Security considerations assessed (risk level, threats, mitigations — or marked N/A)
    Explicit boundaries define what AI should NOT touch or modify
    Open questions capture any unresolved items

Template Reference

Use the structure from system/templates/spec-template.md:

# Spec: [Name]

## Overview
## Target User
## Problem Statement
## User Stories (with Given-When-Then acceptance criteria)
## Invariants & Edge Cases (properties, edge cases, failure modes)
## Detailed Requirements
## Scope (MVP vs Future)
## Technical Context
## Test Strategy (test levels, verification approach, baseline impact)
## Security Considerations (risk level, threats, mitigations)
## Explicit Boundaries (what AI should NOT touch)
## Open Questions
## Success Definition

Handling Incomplete Information

For any section without clear information:

    Mark as [TODO: needs clarification]
    Or mark as [TBD: to be decided during technical design]
    Don't invent details - better to have explicit gaps

Output

The skill outputs:

    A complete spec.md file saved to Library
    A summary of what's captured
    A list of open questions or TODOs
    Recommendation for next step (usually /plan to create the build plan)

Example Output Summary

## Spec Generated

I've created `BrainDrive-Library/projects/active/user-settings/spec.md` with:

**Captured:**
- Clear overview of settings management feature
- Target user: Builders who want to customize their BrainDrive
- Primary flow: Access settings → Modify → Save → See confirmation
- MVP scope: 5 core settings, excludes import/export

**Open Questions:**
- [ ] Should settings sync across devices?
- [ ] What's the reset to defaults behavior?
